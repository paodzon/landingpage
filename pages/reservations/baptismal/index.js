                        <p className="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">The celebration of the Sacrament of Baptism is a communal event within the Holy
                            Mass, scheduled on a designated Sunday for Baptism, from 11:00-12:00 pm. In
                            Baptism, your child becomes a member of the Church, and our parish community is
                            delighted to be present at this significant beginning of your child's faith journey.
                            Baptism becomes more meaningful when more people pray for your child.
                            Note: To emphasize the communitarian dimension of the sacrament, the parish
                            discourages individual/special baptisms, except for serious reasons (medical
                            emergencies, security, etc.). "For convenience" is not considered a serious reason.</p>

                            Parents should be married in the Catholic Church. To nurture their child in the
                            Catholic faith, they are expected to live by Catholic principles. Parishioners married
                            civilly or unmarried must interview the Parish Priest before the seminar. Non-
                            parishioners are advised to conduct baptisms in their respective parishes.

                        <p className="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">Sponsors must be practicing Catholics who have received Baptism, Confirmation,
                            and Holy Eucharist. They actively participate in the Sacramentsâ€”Eucharist and
                            Reconciliation. Sponsors are crucial partners with parents in the Catholic upbringing
                            of the child. Parents are limited to a maximum of five pairs of sponsors</p>
